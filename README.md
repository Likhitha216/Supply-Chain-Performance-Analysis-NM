# Supply-Chain-Performance-Analysis-NM

📦 Supply Chain Performance Analysis using Data Analytics
This project analyzes and visualizes key performance metrics in a supply chain dataset to uncover insights that can inform operational improvements.

🎯 Objective
To analyze supply chain data to:

Identify key trends in order volumes, costs, profits, and delivery times.

Evaluate performance across product categories and regions.

Support data-driven decision-making in supply chain management.

📊 Dataset
Source: The dataset is assumed to be a sample supply chain dataset (such as from Kaggle or internal records), containing fields like Order Date, Category, Region, Sales, Profit, Shipping Cost, and Order Processing Time.

Contents: Includes order-level data with timestamps and associated financial/operational metrics.

🛠️ Technologies Used
